00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.360
<v ->Have you ever had a goal</v>

2
00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.040
that you were really committed to,

3
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.100
but after a lot of work with little reward,

4
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.570
you started feeling like you weren't getting anywhere?

5
00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:15.580
When following through with our goals,

6
00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.380
it's easy to feel defeated.

7
00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.790
But there is something that can help, measurements.

8
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:22.760
When you measure ongoing progress,

9
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.000
you get answers to questions like, "How am I doing?"

10
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.490
And that leads to several benefits.

11
00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.630
So let's take a look at what those benefits are

12
00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.223
and what measurement strategies you can use.

13
00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.840
The first benefit of measuring progress

14
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.660
is that it offers insight into your development.

15
00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.790
Rather than making assumptions based on how you feel,

16
00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.000
you'll have unbiased data that shows you where you're headed

17
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.090
and if that's in the right direction.

18
00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.430
Second, measurements help you uncover and remove obstacles.

19
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.460
By measuring your progress, you'll catch shortcomings

20
00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.790
before you fall too far behind.

21
00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.770
That way, you can make the appropriate changes and improve.

22
00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.500
Next, measurements boost motivation.

23
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.040
By measuring your progress,

24
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.370
you'll see how every action you take,

25
00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:13.030
no matter how small, brings you a step closer to your goal.

26
00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.750
And those everyday wins

27
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.760
will help build confidence and enthusiasm.

28
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.710
Finally, measurements heighten productivity.

29
00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.880
When you're tracking your day-to-day actions,

30
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.730
you'll be less likely to give in to distractions.

31
00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.540
Plus, by seeing how your efforts are creating real outcomes,

32
00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.053
you'll feel encouraged to continue improving those numbers.

33
00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.080
So with all of those benefits,

34
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.840
what's the best way to measure your progress?

35
00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.633
Let's unpack four common strategies.

36
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.580
First, you can measure your progress by creating checklists.

37
00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.060
To use this technique,

38
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.080
make a list of milestones on the way to your goal.

39
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.220
For example, if your goal is to learn French,

40
00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.640
you might have items such as reading an educational book,

41
00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.520
attending learning workshops, and taking practice tests.

42
00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.430
Then you can check off each task when it's done

43
00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.770
and see if you're staying on target.

44
00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.710
Next, you can use the paperclip strategy,

45
00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.540
which works great for those goals

46
00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.590
that require an everyday repetitive action

47
00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.060
such as making a set number of calls.

48
00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.270
The strategy involves adding an item

49
00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.350
such as a paperclip to a jar

50
00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.993
every time you perform a needed activity.

51
00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.950
The paperclip strategy works because it gives you

52
00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.540
a visual measurement of small-scale wins,

53
00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.110
and it shows you how each action you take

54
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.733
has a quantifiable value.

55
00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.670
If there's a task you need to perform every day,

56
00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.820
such as making your bed every morning,

57
00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.000
you can practice what's called the Seinfeld method.

58
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.590
The strategy is simple.

59
00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.550
First, grab a calendar.

60
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.750
Then mark an X for each day you perform a needed action.

61
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.870
While straightforward, this method is valuable

62
00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.040
because it gives a visual representation

63
00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.500
of how often you're following through with your targets.

64
00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.740
Plus, as those Xs fill up,

65
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.270
you'll gain added motivation not to break the chain.

66
00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.880
Finally, you can also measure the difference

67
00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.040
between where you are and where you planned on being.

68
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.250
For example, let's say you have a goal

69
00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.790
to wake up at five o'clock every morning.

70
00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.330
You can then measure the difference

71
00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.230
between that expectation and reality.

72
00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:22.240
So if you're waking up

73
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.510
between 7:00 and 8:00 a.m. every morning

74
00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.010
instead of 5:00 a.m.,

75
00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.463
that's your cue to revise your strategy.

76
00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.730
After choosing any one

77
00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.110
or several of those measurement techniques,

78
00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.030
your next step is to review your progress.

79
00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.520
Measurements give you a picture

80
00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.940
of what's working and what isn't,

81
00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.610
but their purpose is to promote action.

82
00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.750
So reflect on how you're doing.

83
00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.860
And if you're falling short, ask yourself why.

84
00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.340
By measuring your results

85
00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.580
and adjusting your strategy as needed,

86
00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.020
you'll make real, tangible progress toward your goals.

87
00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.910
You'll see how small steps lead to bigger strides.

88
00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.210
And you'll feel encouraged to keep pushing

89
00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:03.763
as your goal appears on the horizon.
