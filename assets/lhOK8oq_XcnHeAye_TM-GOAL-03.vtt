00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:05.920
<v ->As much as we hate to admit it,</v>

2
00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.380
we've all set goals that haven't exactly worked out.

3
00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.390
Even if we have a great plan,

4
00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:12.670
life can get busy,

5
00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.740
and we can lose our motivation to keep going.

6
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.400
So, why is it so hard to stick to our goals

7
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.020
and how can we overcome the obstacles?

8
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.803
First, let's take a look at why goals get off track.

9
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.900
To start, our goals can get off track

10
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.030
because our environments might be counterproductive.

11
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:33.990
For example,

12
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:35.570
if you want to quit smoking,

13
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.540
but are living with someone who smokes,

14
00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.860
then you'll find it much harder to quit.

15
00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.230
You're surrounded by constant reminders and cravings.

16
00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.870
Second, we can rely too heavily on motivation.

17
00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.660
No matter how much we want something,

18
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.960
we won't always feel motivated to do

19
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.590
what it takes to get there.

20
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.710
And so, if motivation is the only thing driving you to act,

21
00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.610
you won't get very far.

22
00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.400
Third, we can lose faith in ourselves.

23
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.060
If your self image contradicts your goal,

24
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:06.260
then you'll develop more excuses for

25
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.770
why you can't than reasons for why you can.

26
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:10.603
Finally,

27
00:01:10.603 --> 00:01:13.140
we can get caught in the friction of starting.

28
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.040
Often, it's not so much the work that's hard,

29
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.520
but the effort it takes to start that work.

30
00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.380
And that causes us to give into procrastination,

31
00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.343
choosing instant rewards over long-term goals.

32
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.460
As the roadblocks prove,

33
00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.200
staying on track with your goals

34
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.610
is just as much about the goals you set

35
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.840
as it is about the actions you take,

36
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.973
what you do every day matters.

37
00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.460
So, what can you do to overcome the obstacles

38
00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.160
and stick to your goals?

39
00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.670
First, align your environment with your goals.

40
00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:46.717
Ask yourself,

41
00:01:46.717 --> 00:01:50.380
"What visual cues do I need to aid my goal?"

42
00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.700
Then do some pre-planning and build that space.

43
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.810
For example,

44
00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.060
if your goal is to drink eight glasses of water a day,

45
00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.470
then keeping a jug of water on your desk will help.

46
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.160
Second, create commitment devices.

47
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.720
Commitment devices require making plans

48
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.210
so that you lock in future behaviors.

49
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:10.290
For example,

50
00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:12.010
if you want to learn a new language,

51
00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.360
sign up for classes that require in-person attendance.

52
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.190
Third, create identity-based habits.

53
00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.900
This technique curbs negative self-talk

54
00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.870
by encouraging you to fake it until you make it.

55
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.500
You define who you want to be,

56
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.623
and then follow habits that align with that identity.

57
00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.200
When setting goals,

58
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.230
we tend to think about results,

59
00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.300
but by taking that a step further and considering

60
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.090
who you need to be to reach those outcomes,

61
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.210
you can start to repeat behaviors,

62
00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:42.450
strengthen your beliefs,

63
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.143
and prove to yourself that you can do this.

64
00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.900
Finally, practice habit stacking,

65
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.830
which involves two steps.

66
00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.360
First, make a list of some habits you already follow,

67
00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.070
such as making your bed in the morning

68
00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:57.490
and brushing your teeth.

69
00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:00.590
Then, think about a new goal you want to implement

70
00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.610
and add that activity to your preexisting habit.

71
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:04.640
For example,

72
00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.057
you might say,

73
00:03:06.057 --> 00:03:07.670
"After I brush my teeth,

74
00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.800
I'll journal for 20 minutes."

75
00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.040
This strategy is effective because it links a goal

76
00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.740
to something you already do,

77
00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.640
making it an excellent trick

78
00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.690
if you're having trouble getting started.

79
00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.460
Sticking to your goals isn't easy.

80
00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.600
However, despite the roadblocks,

81
00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.370
there are tips you can follow.

82
00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.340
So, remember the strategies,

83
00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.300
focus on aligning your identity,

84
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.900
environment, and habits with your goals

85
00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.880
and make the right daily choices.

86
00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.300
That way you won't just set goals,

87
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.883
you'll stick to them as well.
