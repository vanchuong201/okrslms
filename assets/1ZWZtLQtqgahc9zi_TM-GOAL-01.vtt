00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.260
<v ->Is there something you'd like to do right now</v>

2
00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.210
that you just haven't gotten around to achieving?

3
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.190
For example, maybe you have an unused guitar

4
00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:14.860
collecting dust in the corner of your bedroom.

5
00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.160
You keep telling yourself

6
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.050
that you'll learn to play one day,

7
00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:19.220
but something always seems

8
00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:20.740
to get in the way.

9
00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.160
Ambition is common,

10
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.750
and it comes in all shapes and forms.

11
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.030
Unfortunately, turning ambition into reality

12
00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:30.040
takes more than wishful thinking.

13
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.090
So how do we get past the hoping stage

14
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.800
and move into action?

15
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.143
The trick lies in setting goals.

16
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.960
When you set a goal,

17
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.080
you follow a process that requires two elements.

18
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.020
A goal and a system.

19
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.630
A goal is a desirable future event.

20
00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:48.680
It's something clear

21
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.960
and specific you want to achieve.

22
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.070
For example, you might set a goal

23
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.400
to become a team manager

24
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.320
within the next three years.

25
00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.380
A system is a process.

26
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.840
It's the method used to reach a goal

27
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.680
and it's often recurring.

28
00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.700
For example, if you want to become a team manager,

29
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.350
your system might include

30
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.800
leading team projects,

31
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.480
training new employees,

32
00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.023
and strengthening your skills.

33
00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.270
Goal setting is about choosing a destination

34
00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.360
and then deciding how to get there.

35
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.450
It's a way of routing your objectives in reality.

36
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.303
But like most things worth having,

37
00:01:23.303 --> 00:01:26.390
it takes some sacrifice and work.

38
00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.380
For example, continuing with our team manager example,

39
00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.550
you'll need to avoid procrastination.

40
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.610
Resist short-term incentives

41
00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.340
to take on easier projects

42
00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.850
and accept more responsibility in the office.

43
00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.550
As you consider what goals

44
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.140
you might set for yourself,

45
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.150
keep those inevitable sacrifices in mind.

46
00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.580
A great goal is one that matters to you personally.

47
00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.870
So contemplate the reward you want

48
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.714
and the price you're willing to pay for it.

49
00:01:54.714 --> 00:01:57.455
If this all sounds like too much work,

50
00:01:57.455 --> 00:01:59.280
don't be dissuaded.

51
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.300
Setting goals is important for several reasons.

52
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.760
For one, it builds motivation.

53
00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:05.800
Set a goal

54
00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:06.980
and you take your dreams

55
00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.300
out of the idealistic hoping stage

56
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.150
and put them into action.

57
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.780
As you work toward your goal,

58
00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.870
you'll see a motivational endpoint

59
00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.070
that will make the sacrifices feel worthwhile.

60
00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.120
Goals also work because they give you direction.

61
00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.750
Instead of aimlessly going with the flow,

62
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.900
setting a goal helps you understand

63
00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.000
what behaviors are worth your time

64
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.820
and which ones aren't.

65
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.310
Third goal setting promotes discipline and growth.

66
00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.010
It helps you feel accountable to yourself.

67
00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.540
And with a specific timeframe

68
00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:38.780
to complete your goal,

69
00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.200
you'll also have urgency

70
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.483
to keep pushing forward.

71
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.560
It's easy to fall back into old habits,

72
00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.810
but a strong goal encourages you to keep going

73
00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.780
and follow through with your plans.

74
00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:51.770
Set a goal

75
00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.150
and you'll find it easier

76
00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.370
to stay locked in,

77
00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.483
and resist tempting distractions.

78
00:02:57.437 --> 00:02:59.787
Forth because setting involves

79
00:02:59.787 --> 00:03:02.800
making precise time-bound commitments,

80
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.810
it also provides a measuring tool.

81
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:05.740
And with that,

82
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.210
you can track your progress

83
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:10.420
and take the element of surprise out of success.

84
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.530
Finally, by setting a goal

85
00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:13.930
and tracking your results,

86
00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.530
you'll maintain momentum.

87
00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.140
You'll begin to see an increasingly larger gap

88
00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.000
between where you started and where you are now.

89
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.290
And that will encourage you to stay on course

90
00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.253
and push through those milestones.

91
00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.610
If you have an aspiration,

92
00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.260
don't just commit to getting around to it.

93
00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.110
Instead, set a goal

94
00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.520
and take that first critical step.

95
00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.300
A defined goal will give you

96
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.140
the motivation to get started

97
00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.810
and the long-term direction to stay on track.

98
00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.270
Focus on what you want,

99
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:45.619
and the sacrifices it takes to get there.

100
00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:48.353
And you'll turn your dreams into reality.
