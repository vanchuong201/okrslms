00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:05.010
<v ->Let's face it.</v>

2
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.590
Reaching your goals is rarely easy.

3
00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:11.300
Goals by their very nature are difficult to achieve.

4
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.640
And if you're not setting them in the right way,

5
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.920
they can start to feel impossible.

6
00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.700
So, how do you set goals that actually work?

7
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.050
The method you use matters.

8
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.000
To succeed you need to follow a process and align your goals

9
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.593
with the SMART acronym.

10
00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:32.030
Let's start with the goal-setting process.

11
00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:35.310
The first step is to get your ideas on paper,

12
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.120
by writing down large scale goals.

13
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.310
During this stage, consider what you'd like to achieve,

14
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.190
create, have, experience, or give.

15
00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.110
Then, pick your top goal from the list.

16
00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.090
Which objective means the most to you right now?

17
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.080
The best goals are self-motivating.

18
00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.460
So, put aside what others want from you

19
00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.730
and focus on what you want.

20
00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.530
Once you have that top goal,

21
00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.400
break it down by setting smaller milestones.

22
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.070
By mapping out those checkpoints, your goal will start

23
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.760
to feel more realistic.

24
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.520
Next, right up the steps it will take to reach

25
00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.520
each of those smaller milestones.

26
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.470
This is your chance to come up with specific

27
00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.280
play by play directions.

28
00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.660
Finally, schedule ongoing process reviews.

29
00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.070
Goal-setting is an ongoing activity,

30
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.820
to stay on track you'll need to continually review

31
00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:25.960
your process.

32
00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.380
Notice what's working and what isn't

33
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.023
and make adjustments as needed.

34
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.620
When following the goal-setting process,

35
00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.000
you'll also need to ensure that you're creating

36
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.020
a powerful goal rooted in reality.

37
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.360
The best goals are SMART, which stands for

38
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.110
specific, measurable, attainable, relevant,

39
00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.223
and time-bound.

40
00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.300
Let's break that SMART acronym down.

41
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.500
First specific goals are well-defined.

42
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.650
They offer sufficient direction as to where exactly

43
00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.060
you want to go.

44
00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.150
The more details the better.

45
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.030
Measurable goals are ones that you can track.

46
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.990
They use quantifiable benchmarks, such as dates and amounts.

47
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.130
Instead of I want to start meditating, they say,

48
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.420
I want to meditate for 15 minutes every day.

49
00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.030
Attainable goals are ones you can realistically achieve.

50
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.550
They're challenging, but not impossible.

51
00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.980
They answer yes to questions such as,

52
00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.260
do I have enough resources, time, and funds

53
00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.800
to make this happen?

54
00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.140
Relevant goals are ones that means something to you.

55
00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.920
They are relevant to your ambitions,

56
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.960
and that makes them worthwhile.

57
00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.090
Finally, time-bound goals have a deadline.

58
00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.770
They create internal pressure

59
00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.063
by following a strict timeframe and target due date.

60
00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.800
Not all goals are created equal.

61
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.050
The more thought and time you put into setting your goals,

62
00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.210
the more likely you are to follow through with them later.

63
00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:56.170
So, if you have an ambition, take the time to turn it

64
00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.530
into a goal.

65
00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.770
Follow that five step process, and then boost your chances

66
00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.760
of success by keeping that goal SMART.

67
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.233
Soon, those sky high ambitions won't seem so out of reach.
